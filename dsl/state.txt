We are working with a greenhouse project as well, specifically rows of certain specicies of plants with specific needs.
Each row is only for a single species of plants. E.g. a row for tomatoes and a row for cucumbers.
Both the greenhouse itself and each row individually can have a variety of sensors and actuators associated with it.
E.g. the greenhouse can have a temperature sensor and a collection of window openers as actuators.
The sensors are responsible for sending their value to a specified topic - this does not really require special logic, so
we dont think it is really necessary to use the DSL to generate this logic. The same goes for the actuators, they are only
responsible for receiving commands on mqtt topics and execute the commands (like open a window).
Instead, the DSL should be responsible for generating the controller. 
The controller is responsible for handling the state of both sensors and actuators, which are used to create the optimal 
ecosystem environment for the plant. 
The optimal environment is stated in terms of required sensor values. E.g. for tomatoes, the temperature should 
ideally be 22 degrees. Based on the values, the temperature sensor can be in five different states: 
Hot, Warm, Optimal, Chilled and Cold.
To manipulate the environment, actuators can be used by the controller. E.g. to manipulate the temperature, 
a window-opener can be used to open the window to a variety of stages, going from 20% open to 40%, 60% and 100% open.
In the rules, we want to state how the sensors and actuators are connected to each other. E.g. If the sensor is in state Warm,
then the window opener should open 40%.

We want to generate two things
- The C# code for the controller, where
